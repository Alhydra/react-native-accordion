My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://reactnativemaster.com) I have recently wrote an article exploring how to render a React Native Accordion, And this repository contains the code I have used, feel free to use it in your project and share it with your peers, if you feel like reading the article, which I recommend follow this link [Elegant Accordion Design Using React Native](https://reactnativemaster.com/elegant-accordion-design-using-react-native/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an [Expo.io Project](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-accordion)
